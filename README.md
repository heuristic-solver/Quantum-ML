# Quantum Computing Projects

Welcome to my GitHub profile! This repository contains a collection of my quantum computing projects using Qiskit. Below are descriptions of two key projects included in this repository.
Projects
# 1. Quantum k-Nearest Neighbors (QkNN)

This project implements a simple quantum k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify data points. The code includes both classical and quantum implementations for comparison.

# Files:

    Qknn.py

# Description:
The Qknn.py script performs the following tasks:

Normalize training and query data.
Calculate classical probabilities using Euclidean distances.
Create and simulate a quantum circuit for the quantum k-NN algorithm.
Compare classical and quantum results.

# Usage:

Install Qiskit and other required libraries:

    pip install qiskit matplotlib



# 2. Quantum Circuit Simulation

This project demonstrates a basic quantum circuit simulation using Qiskit. It includes the creation and simulation of a simple quantum circuit with entanglement.

# Files:

    simulating.py

# Description:
The simulating.py script performs the following tasks:

Create a quantum circuit with two qubits.
Apply Hadamard and CNOT gates to create entanglement.
Measure the qubits and save the state vector.
Run the simulation and plot the results.

# Usage:

    
    pip install qiskit matplotlib


    python simulating.py
