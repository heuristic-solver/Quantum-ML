# Quantum Computing Projects

Welcome to my GitHub profile! This repository contains a collection of my quantum computing projects using Qiskit. Below are descriptions of two key projects included in this repository.
Projects
1. Quantum k-Nearest Neighbors (QkNN)

This project implements a simple quantum k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify data points. The code includes both classical and quantum implementations for comparison.

Files:

    Qknn.py

Description:
The Qknn.py script performs the following tasks:

    Normalize training and query data.
    Calculate classical probabilities using Euclidean distances.
    Create and simulate a quantum circuit for the quantum k-NN algorithm.
    Compare classical and quantum results.

Usage:

    Install Qiskit and other required libraries:

    bash

pip install qiskit matplotlib

Run the script:

bash

    python Qknn.py

Key Features:

    Initializes a quantum circuit with data points.
    Applies Hadamard gates and measures qubits.
    Calculates and prints classical and quantum probabilities.
    Visualizes the quantum circuit and intermediate state vectors.

2. Quantum Circuit Simulation

This project demonstrates a basic quantum circuit simulation using Qiskit. It includes the creation and simulation of a simple quantum circuit with entanglement.

Files:

    simulating.py

Description:
The simulating.py script performs the following tasks:

    Create a quantum circuit with two qubits.
    Apply Hadamard and CNOT gates to create entanglement.
    Measure the qubits and save the state vector.
    Run the simulation and plot the results.

Usage:

    Install Qiskit and other required libraries:

    bash

pip install qiskit matplotlib

Run the script:

bash

    python simulating.py

Key Features:

    Initializes a quantum circuit with two qubits.
    Applies Hadamard and CNOT gates to create entanglement.
    Simulates the circuit and plots the measurement results.
    Visualizes the quantum circuit.
